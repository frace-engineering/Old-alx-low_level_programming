# 0X13-MORE SINGLY_LINKED_LISTS

This project is to further check our understanding of the linked list in C programming language.
In this folder, we have 11 mandatory tasks.
The lists.h file contains the prototype of all the functions used in this project including the _putchar.c.

1. The 0-print_listint.c is a c file that prints the items in the linked list with head *h.
2. The 1-listint_len.c is a c file that returns the number of elements in the linked list.
3. The 2-add_nodeint.c is a c function that add a new node at the begining of the linked list.
4. The 3-add_nodeint_end.c is a c file that adds a new node at the end of the linked list.
5. The 4-free_listint.c is a c file that frees the memory mapped for the linked list.
6. The 6-pop_listint.c is a c file that deleted the head nod of a linked list and returns the element of the head.
7. The 7-get_nodeint.c is a c file that returns the element at a perticular node of a linked list, return NULL if node does not exist.
8. The 8-sum_listint.c is a c file that returns the sum of all the elements in a linked list.
9. The 9-insert_nodeint.c inserts a node at any given point on the linked list.
10. The 10-delete_nodeint.c is a c function that deletes the node at a given index of the linked list.
